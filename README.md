Real-Time Collaborative Tool for Coding/Note-Taking
This project is a real-time collaborative platform that allows multiple users to work on coding or note-taking simultaneously, similar to tools like Google Docs. Built using Flask and Flask-SocketIO, the tool uses WebSockets to provide real-time updates between users. When one user makes an edit, all other connected users see the change instantly without needing to refresh the page. The editor is designed with a contenteditable element, making it simple and responsive for users to collaborate on shared content in real time.

Key Features:

Real-time collaboration via WebSocket connections

Multi-user support

Simple text editor with instant updates

Built using Flask and Flask-SocketIO for backend communication

This tool can be extended with features such as user authentication, saving documents, or adding advanced text editing options.
